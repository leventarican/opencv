* most basic operations like addition and multiplication are very heavily used in all image processing and computer vision applications
* mathematical operations on matrices
* two simple operations on images that change the brightness and contrast of the image which use the arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication respectively.
* data type conversion. ex. initially its 24-bit (= 8bits per channel)
