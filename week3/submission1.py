# Coin Detection Assignment

# this assignment will require you to use a lot of algorithms discussed in week3 and before.
# for example: Thresholding, Morphological Operations, Blob Detection, Contour Detection, Connected Component Analysis

# Grading Rubric
# 1. Read image - 1 point
# 2. Convert image to grayscale - 1 point
# 3. Split image into R,G,B channels - 1 point
# 4. Perform thresholding - 2 points
# 5. Perform morphological operations - 4 points
# 6. Detect coins (blob detection) - 1 point
# 7. Display the detected coins - 2 points
# 8. Perform CCA - 1 point
# 9. Perform contour detection and fit circles - 2 points
